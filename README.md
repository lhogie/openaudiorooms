AudioRooms is a network application allowing music bands to rehearse in a (virtual) room when members cannot meet physically.
AudioRooms relies on the UDP protocol in P2P communications, thereby providing the lowest latency possible.
AudioRooms is a standalone application for Android/iPhone smartphones and Windows/MacOSX/Linux computers.
When AudioRooms starts, band members are asked for the name of the room they want to join. The application queries the AudioRooms registry for the IP address of the others in the same room. Then the audio input of the musician's device is transferred simultaneously to everyone in the room. In order to minimize latency and to provide best quality, the audio in sent in uncompressed CD-quality (16bit 44.1kHz).
As AudioRooms imposes no restriction on the number of people in a room, people are able to attend a session, thereby forming a virtual concert.
AudioRooms is also perfectly suited to audio conferencing.
It does not transmit video and never will. (Quality) Audio only.
